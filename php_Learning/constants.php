<!-- PHP Constants
A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be changed during the script.

A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore (no $ sign before the constant name).

Note: Unlike variables, constants are automatically global across the entire script.

 <?php
 define("cars",["baleno","BMW","Toyoto"]);
 echo cars[0];
 ?>
